		"The BUNNIGHT is known for chivalrous yet fierce swordfighting. A natural-born leader, this bunny can typically be found in the front lines of a battle, protecting its fellow battlers at all costs. Thanks to its finely-crafted sword, shield and armor, this bunny has good DEFENSE and moderate ATTACK. However, this equipment is heavy, making this bunny lag behind its teammates when it comes to SPEED.",
		"The BUNNECROMANCER is a mysteryious mage of unknown origin. Quiet and cunning, this bunny enjoys learning all there is to know about magic. With all-around moderate ATTACK, DEFENSE, and SPEED, this bunny typically plays an offensive support role on the battlefield, using its magical knowledge to outsmart foes.",
		"The BUNNURSE is a kind mage, specializing in healing magic. This bunny just can't stand to see its allies in pain! While it has poor ATTACK and SPEED, this bunny has excellent DEFENSE, allowing it to take more than a few hits as it heals the rest of the team.",
		"The BUNNE'ER-DO-WELL is a fistfighter with a temper. The mere suggestion of a battle sets this hothead charging forward with a flurry of punches. With good ATTACK, enemies won't know what hit them once this bunny has had a go. However, in its rage, it forgets about strategy, leading to poor DEFENSE and moderate SPEED."
