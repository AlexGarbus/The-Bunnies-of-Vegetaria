# Summary
*The Bunnies of Vegetaria* is a small role-playing game created as the final project for Code Louisville's C# .NET course at Bellarmine University. The game tells the story of Vegetaria, a nation of bunnies under attack from vegetable monsters. Players control a brigade of 4 bunnies - each with their own unique stats and skills - and battle against the monsters in turn-based combat, with the ultimate goal of clearing each area and reclaiming Vegetaria.
