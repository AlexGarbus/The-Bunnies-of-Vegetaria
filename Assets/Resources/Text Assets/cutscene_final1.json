    "BUNNEFARIOUS now channels that forbidden magic into the carrots grown at CARROT TOP. But why?",
    "Wait! Carrots strengthen vision. Carrots with forbidden magic would give BUNNEFARIOUS vision of everything! He aims to become an all-knowing deity!",
    "But, it takes time to imbue powerful vegetables like carrots with magic energy. To buy time, BUNNEFARIOUS transformed the weaker vegetables into monsters!",
    "The carrots are almost fully-charged with magic, but there's still time!\nGo, bunnies! Defeat BUNNEFARIOUS! For all the bunnies of VEGETARIA!"
